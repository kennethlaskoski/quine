Quine implementations

A [quine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine_(computing))
is a computer program which takes no input and produces a copy of its own source code as its only output.

This repository is a collection of quines (*i.e., self-replicating* programs) written in various languages.
An added goal is that the sources here must compile with the simplest command that produces a binary
(e.g. ```cc main.c```) and that they are human-readable, preferably passing some established code formatter
for the respective language.
